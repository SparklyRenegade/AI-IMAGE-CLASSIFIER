# AI-IMAGE-CLASSIFIER


**Project Overview**
This project focuses on web scraping, deep learning, and application deployment. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been developed to classify images as either real or AI-generated, leveraging various tools and frameworks for web scraping, machine learning, and app development.


**Goals**
Collect Images: Use Selenium to scrape images from the internet.

Build CNN Model: Develop a CNN-based image classifier using TensorFlow.

Integrate Model: Deploy the model within a web application.

Web App: Used Streamlit here in this project.

**Tech Stack / Frameworks**

Web Scraping: Selenium

Machine Learning: TensorFlow

App Development: Streamlit (for web)
